### Project Result — Face Detection in Video

The screenshot below demonstrates the real-time face detection output on video using **OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier**.  
The system successfully identifies a face in the video, draws a bounding box around it, and displays the **number of detected faces** and **frames per second (FPS)** on the screen.  

This verifies that the model can process each frame efficiently while maintaining accuracy.  
The project highlights how computer vision can be used to analyze video content and detect human faces in real time.
